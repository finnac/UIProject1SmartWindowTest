# Ashley's Smart Window UI Documentation

- You will need to install: React, bootstrap, deepmerge, rc-slider, and bootstrap packages with the npm install command
- To run, clone this repo in visual studio code and open up a new terminal, and run the command "npm run dev". (I used the run instructions from the module on the class canvas page when we first started setting up, so it should follow that procedure aside from needing to install rc-slider, deepmerge, and bootstrap packages which can be found with npm install (insert package name with no parenthesis). )
- Follow the link provided to you by the terminal and start to access the smart window UI!
