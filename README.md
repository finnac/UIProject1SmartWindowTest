# Ashley's Smart Window UI Documentation

- You will need to install: React, bootstrap, deepmerge, rc-slider, and bootstrap packages with the npm install command
- To run, clone this repo in visual studio code and open up a new terminal, and run the command "npm run dev". Ensure the folder called "MyFirstReactApp" is selected (I used the run instructions from the module on the class, so it should follow that procedure aside from needing to install rc-slider, deepmerge, and bootstrap)
- Follow the link provided to you by the terminal and start to access the smart window UI!
